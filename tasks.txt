TASKS:

1) KCOR:
	- check auto_cv_brent progress.

2) Tom-code:
	- Revisar los cambios con Rich. Pulir. Una vez que esté todo, compare.c to match build_subA.c in terms of handling COMP.
	- geomtest to find source of artifacts.
(DONE)	  Keep comparing outputs of two geomtest.c experiments b4 doing anyhyhing else.
(*)       Try with a known x-object, a radially stratified spherically symmetric sphere, and also a cylindrical object, for example.
(*)	- to use auto_cv_brent with multiple reg matrices, expand IDL derivs_hollowsph.pro to create R3 matrix being the stack of hplaplac and d2r.

3) Multi-instrumental multi-wavelength tom: 
	- ingestion of tomographies and creation of y-vector
	- cost function
	- minimization scheme

4) CoMP:
	- check auto_cv_brent progress.
	- absolute units in comp_prep.pro tool and compare with synth intensity.

----------------------------------------------------------------

1) geomtest.c to find geometric bug in LOS calculation.

2) Finish paper seed:
	- nominal/extended telemetry orbits
	- heliosphere is not rotating rigidly, so extended telemetry periods could not be as suseful as shown in our work. pose the future plan of incorprating a differential rotation model.
	- main utility of tomography is at lower heights in the latter orbits. Even if reduced to about 1/2 of the longitudes, tomography will be possible with much shorter gathering-time periods. For example, in Orbit 24, tomography in the range 2 to 8 Rsun will be possible with only 3 days of daata gathering around perihelion, with data taken within a maximum dstance of 0.1 AU.
	- reduce the number of plots, don't show crap.

PRIORITY-1

* Implement K-cor tomography and perform a reconstruction of of new rotation using K-cor and also AIA-DEMT. Diego. DONE.

* Check formulae for pB and BK, including units.

* KCOR Tom: 1) try different grids (ongoing)
            2) try different reg. levels once a grid is decided. (ongoing)
            3) compare.c images, analyze units. (ongoing)
            4) Analyze binning of many images, how much improvement can we get.
            5) Decide CR, get also LAM Lasco-C2 images, compare radial profiles in Streamers, Diego.
            6) perform and compare: KCOR-tom, DEMT, LASCO-tom, LASCO+KCOR-tom. Diego.

* Determine problem with artifacts in synthetic images, likely to be present in build_subA.c too, due to LOSs nearly parallel to cells' boundaries. Use RAYDIAGNOSE and geomtest.c. Add other tests if needed. Most probably problem is related to handling of the "grideps" variable in buildrow.c

* FoF-8 and COLAGE-XI talks.

* New imagecheck.pro. Underway. Diego is in charge.

* Do Coverage plots of planned Science orbits (r < 0.25 AU), and perform Orbit 01 reconstruction bsed only on that data. DONE.

* Do the math of p_opt for hollow tom with both Npixels and norms. Get back to Diego. DONE.

* Make a Longitude-RadEast/RadWest plot of the time series for each orbit to show the space (rad-lon) of data coverage for tomography. Overplot WISPR-I and -O with different colors. Make another one also overplotting complementary coverage that would be obtained by roll-opps. DONE.

* Make WISPR-I/O tomography using fake circular orbits, so that height coverage is constant over longitude. This aims at proving that all codes are correctly working with WISPR. DONE.

* Re-do real and circular orbits with 3-reg matrices and idendity. DONE. But must be re-done when these matrices are correctly implemented.

* Add IDENTITY matrix to regularization matrix. DONE, NOT RIGHT YET: there are problem with both 3regmat and identity.

* Compare CR-2081 AWSoM model with LAM LASCO-C2 images. DONE.

* Ordenar y depurar el directorio /data1/work/SPP/SORBET_VIZZER_WISPR_RevA/ y lo que contiene. wispr_tool debería estar llamando kernels agrupados o bien en su directorio de SolarSoft o bien en UN SOLO directorio propio, fácil de trackear. Asegurarse de esto.

PRIORITY-2

* Put into #include files all shared code between build_subA.c and compare.c, evaluating first how many #include files this approach would take. 

* Organize better printouts, as I added a few. Put them between an appropiate pre-processor directive.

* Implement COMP tomography.

* Sin(theta) grid.

TOMOGRAPHY

* Read papers on regularization and read matrix theory
